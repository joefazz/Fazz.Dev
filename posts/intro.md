Long time readers will know that this blog lived under a different domain and a different stack. When I first decided that I wanted to try doing a blog I was all in on React Native. It was my full time job, I had a [side project I was working on until 2am every night on](/projects/flatmates) and I wanted to start going a bit deeper into the world wide web aspect of React so I thought a Gatsby blog would be a good place to start.

Here I am now almost a year later (10 months to be exact) and I'm a full time web developer after finishing my degree in Computer Science. I don't work with React anymore, although I still like it a lot [see here](https://github.com/joefazz/codexe), I work with Angular every day now which is an entertaining turn of events if you think about it for long enough which I try not to. Seeing as I've accidently ended up working with React, Vue.js and Angular I thought to myself.

> Why stop there?!

So I decided I would try and make my new blog with my shiny new domain in Svelte using it's Next.js like framework [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev).

Here's some stuff I really like about this so far having gone through the entire process from start to finish.

Pros:

- Svelte is genuinely a new clever web framework
- Sapper is part of the Svelte family (unlike Next.js being independent to React)
- It wasn't super hard to learn having had experience with Angular and Vue (obviously your mileage may vary. I'd say it's like the template style of Angular with the component/styling style of Vue)

Cons:

- It's new so you're one of the first people solving problems (looking at you markdown to HTML conversion)
- No TypeScript support but it's being worked on (this isn't a con for me I'm not a big fan)
- VSCode support is okay but not 10/10

I realise my cons list is me saying "it's new" in 3 different ways but that's deliberate.
