    I consider my journey into Generative Art to be one of the first things to spark in me that I could use
    computers, not just to make useful software, but to make useless art which I think we can all agree is 
    far more interesting.

  <p class="my-2">
    It feels difficult to try and describe what I like about this without sounding pretentious but I think what
    really appeals to me is the fact that computers are bad at creating mess and when you try to encourage it to
    do so you can end up with really striking visuals that it feels only a computer could make.  Bugs in the code 
    can become more than just a headache to fix they can accidentally create something you never intended to make.
