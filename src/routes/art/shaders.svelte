    Shaders are one of those concepts that I was pretty convinced I would never actually understand and only people
    far more intelligent than me (the shader magi) would be able to create something amazing with them. This is not the case and actually, for me it's turned into a bit of a gateway drug
    into wanted to learn more about how graphics and rendering actually works.

    The first shader I wrote was with <a class="underline text-theme-darker" href="https://threejs.com">Three.js</a> following along to a Creative Coding course on Frontend Masters by
    <a class="underline text-theme-darker" href="https://www.instagram.com/mattdesl_art/">Matt DesLauriers</a>. I would be lying if I said I understood every line I wrote and even now I look back 
    over it and have to remind myself of the purpose of certain lines. However it is something I'm quite proud of 
    and even though lines of code wise it's fairly simple, the effect is quite impressive and something I find really
    satisfying to have made.

    I've been trying to find time to experiment with more shaders in unity
    that are focused on games so below is my inaugeral water shader which was the first time I had really tried using
    ShaderGraph in anger. I'm actually really happy with the result but would like to go further to fix things like the 
    shadow distortion and making it look less 'voronoi'.
