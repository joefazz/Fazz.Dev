    Shaders are one of those concepts that I was pretty convinced I would never actually understand and only people
    far more intelligent than me (the shader magi) would be able to create something amazing with them. It turns
    out that (shockingly (not)) this is not the case and actually, for me it's turned into a bit of a gateway drug
    into wanted to learn more about how graphics and rendering actually works.

    The first shader I wrote was with Three.js following along to a Creative Coding course on Frontend Masters by
    Matt Desel (fix the name). I would be lying if I said I understood every line I wrote and even now I look back 
    over it and have to remind myself of the purpose of certain lines. However it is something I'm quite proud of 
    and even though lines of code wise it's fairly simple, the effect is quite impressive and something I find really
    satisfying to have made.

    Since working in Unity naturally any shaders I get to write in my day to day are going to be for Unity's materials.
    At the time of writing I've only had to do one shader while at GS which was to create a 2D color disc which was far 
    more interesting then it might seem. Since then though I've been trying to find time to experiment with more shaders
    that are focused on games so below is my inaugeral water shader which was the first time I had really tried using
    ShaderGraph in anger. I'm actually really happy with the result but would like to go further to fix things like the 
    shadow distortion and making it look less 'voronoi'.

    This project only has a deployed frontend no backend support is deployed, although cloning 
    the repo and running it alongside the frontend should work.

    I also wrote a ~15 thousand word dissertation on this project available for
    perusing.
