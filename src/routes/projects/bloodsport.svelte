  <p class="my-2">
    Bloodsport is my attempt at making an arena shooter with Unity in the same vein as Devil Daggers. It was the first time that
    I made a first person game and a lot of the time I spent on it was about how I wanted the different system to work together
    in code. 

    I haven't worked on it in a little while at the time of writing but the base of a game is sitting there with a moving main character, enemies and 
    a weapon.

  <b>Fun stuff I got to try:</b>
  <ul>
    <li class="my-1 italic">- Lighting in arenas</li>
    <li class="my-1 italic">- Input System 2.0 again but a bit of a different approach this time</li>
    <li class="my-1 italic">- Movement with the Unity Character Controller</li>
    <li class="my-1 italic">- Using NavMeshAgents for an Enemy AI</li>
  </ul>
