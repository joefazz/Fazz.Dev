      Hi! Welcome to my blog/portfolio.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      I'm Joe, a Web Engineer based in London, UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first got into coding when I was young trying to copy my dad who is also a Developer,
      the first language I learnt was Ruby on Codecademy. I got into JavaScript during a placement 
      at a start up in the UK called <a href="https://fluid.work" class="underline text-theme">Fluid</a> 
      where I was tasked to develop and maintain their React Native codebase.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Since then I graduated from university with a First and now work at <a href="https://gravitysketch.com" class="underline text-theme">Gravity Sketch</a>
      on their cloud platform <a href="https://landingpad.me" class="underline text-theme">Landing Pad</a>
    </p>
    <p class="my-2 mb-4">
      I enjoy doing public speaking and have done two technical talks, one at React London
      on <i>React Native</i> (available to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFiDHJBVKyA" class="underline text-theme">here</a>) and one at Google Developer Group doing a workshop and talk on
      <i>React</i>.
